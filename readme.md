# Project Overview

This repository contains Jupyter notebooks for the project, spanning six weeks of development from Week 06 to Week 11. Each notebook builds upon the previous week's work, providing a structured approach to the project.

## Repository Structure

The repository includes the following files:

- Dataset preprocessing
- Collaborative Filtering Recommender System
- Evaluation of Recommender Systems
- Text Representation
- Content-Based Recommender System
- Hybrid Recommender System

## Environment Setup

To ensure compatibility, use the following dependencies:

```
numpy==1.24.4
pandas==1.5.3
```

### Installation Instructions

You can set up the environment using the following steps:

1. **Create a virtual environment (optional but recommended):**
   ```sh
   python -m venv venv
   source venv/bin/activate  # On macOS/Linux
   venv\Scripts\activate  # On Windows
   ```

2. **Install dependencies:**
   ```sh
   pip install numpy==1.24.4 pandas==1.5.3
   ```

3. **Launch Jupyter Notebook:**
   ```sh
   jupyter notebook
   ```

## Usage
1. Open the relevant Jupyter notebook (`.ipynb` file) in Jupyter Notebook or Jupyter Lab.
2. Follow the provided instructions and run the code cells sequentially.
3. Each week's notebook builds upon the previous one, so it's recommended to follow them in order.
